I'm currently a freshman at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science planning on double majoring in AI and Mathematics. 

My passions lie at the intersection of computer science and mathematics. Throughout high school, I participated in many math contests as an individual, part of my school's team, or representing Canada at the International Mathematical Olympiad in 2019 and 2020. I'm currently involved in organizing CMIMC and worked on the website [here](https://cmimcprogramming.org/).

My hobbies include solving various sudoku variants and gaming. I play chess online casually, mostly playing blitz, and am currently sitting around around 1800 rating on lichess.org and chess.com. As well, I enjoy having fun with friends by playing League of Legends and Valorant, and for single player games, I absolutely love the thrill of conducting my own empire expansion in Total War games.
