And it's summer. I just finished registration yesterday and it was super easy because I got lucky with an early time slot. Just picked the courses I had planned and I'm done. 

On the other hand, I'm working on a new html page linked <a href="https://itangdav.github.io/DatabaseOfERGs">here</a> related to the combinatorics research I'm doing this summer. It's a list of complete enumerations for edge-regular graph parameter sets. 

Also, I recently volunteered to proctor and grade ARML which was really fun. Had a great time meeting some of the math contest people from my high school again. Kinda miss math contests but honestly I don't miss the stress at all, just the fun parts.
