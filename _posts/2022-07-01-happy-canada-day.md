Happy Canada Day! I'm busy this summer doing a remote internship at NVIDIA, but finally got time to make another blog post for this year's Canada Day. Looking forward to making more updates to my blog when my life becomes exciting, such as watching Canada at WC 2022! Let's try to at least get 1 win in the group stages, would be amazing to get a win vs top teams like Belgium and Croatia.
