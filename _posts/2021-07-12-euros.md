Just watched the Euro 2020 final yesterday and what a shootout it was! Italy were certainly deserved winners so congrats to them. 

Also, I've been working on a few small changes to my website recently which includes adding favicons and using flexbox for the project cards. Hopefully I'll find more time to work on my website in the future, but am also starting to finalize my draft for the paper I'm writing about edge regular graph enumeration. You can read more about that <a href="https://itangdav.github.io/DatabaseOfERGs">here</a>.
