This blog has been inactive for quite a while, but I have some time this summer before I start doing full-time Fantasy Premier League starting tomorrow. 
I have some problem handouts from July 2020 that I haven't previously posted because it's pretty low quality (just a compilation of AIME/Oly problems). 
I'm going to create a new folder in handouts just for them [here.](https://github.com/itangdav/my-blog/tree/master/assets/handouts/Problems_Only)

On the topic of FPL, please get well soon Reese James, I need you as my differential!
