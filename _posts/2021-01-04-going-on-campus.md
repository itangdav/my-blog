Yay, I'm moving into campus for the first time on Jan 23rd. Looking forward to it, less than 3 weeks left!

I guess one thing I'll miss is the amount of soccer I am watching nowadays. Once classes start again, I won't have time to do that. I'm hoping that my classes next semester are fun though and that I get approved for an overload + TA position.
