Currently, I am working on a new Game Theory handout based on games without perfect information. In the meantime, I have linked an older handout on game theory below.

Combinatorics is honestly my favourite math subject, so no coincidence that I like CS, and I really enjoy gaming, so game theory seems like a perfect combo between the two.
