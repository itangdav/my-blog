Here is a selection of some of my favourite past handouts that I wrote:

<button name = "button" onclick="location.href='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/AM_GM_Handout.pdf'"> AM GM Handout</button>

<button name = "button" onclick="location.href='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Basic_Inequalities.pdf'"> Basic Inequalities Handout</button>

<button name = "button" onclick="location.href='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Easy_Orders_Handout.pdf'"> Easy Orders Handout</button>

And one of my longest handouts, which attempts to give a general overview of how to use modular arithmetic in high school contests:
